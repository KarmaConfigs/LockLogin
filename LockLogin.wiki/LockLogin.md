# LockLogin wiki

**LockLogin is a plugin that adds extra security to your server. LockLogin supports Spigot & PaperSpigo, Bukkit and BungeeCord.**

**Why is better locklogin than others login plugins?**
**Because it has 2fa, 2fa is a really good way to protect your account, LockLogin's 2fa uses Google API, so, it's event impossible that someone hacks the 2fa server to get your pin and access to your account. LockLogin also protects your account from the "Conectec from another location" message and unlogs you inmediatly when you disconnect from server, so, there's no way that a player with the same ip as yours, logs-in without typing the password or 2fa code.**

**LockLogin's password saving system is full encrypted and uses player UUID instead of his name or IP, so, it's impossible that you lose your account since it's impossible to change your UUID.**

**And finally, the country protection system, this system saves your country and block your account to that country ( If you log from another country you won't be able to join )**
**This can work also as a kind of Anti-VPN system. And yes, you can also block countries from join to your server.**
